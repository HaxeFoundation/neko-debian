Description: High-level dynamically typed programming language
 Neko has been designed to provide a common runtime for several
 different languages, including JavaScript and haXe.
 .
 The compiler converts a source file (.neko) into a bytecode file (.n)
 that can be executed with the Virtual Machine. You can use the
 compiler as standalone commandline executable separated from the VM,
 or as a Neko library to perform compile-and-run for interactive
 languages.
 . 
 The virtual machine is both very lightweight and well optimized. It
 can be easily embedded into other applications, and libraries are
 directly accessible using the C foreign function interface.
