Description: Lightweight virtual machine - headers
 Neko provides a common runtime for several different languages,
 including JavaScript and haXe.
 .
 The virtual machine is both very lightweight and well optimized.  It
 can be easily embedded into other applications, and libraries are
 directly accessible using the C foreign function interface.
 .
 This package includes the header files for development using the Neko
 virtual machine.

Suggests: libapache2-mod-neko, neko-dev
Description: Lightweight virtual machine - compiler and tools
 Neko provides a common runtime for several different languages,
 including JavaScript and haXe.
 .
 The compiler converts a source file (.neko) into a bytecode file (.n)
 that can be executed with the Virtual Machine.  You can use the
 compiler as standalone commandline executable separated from the
 virtual machine, or as a Neko library to perform compile-and-run for
 interactive languages.
